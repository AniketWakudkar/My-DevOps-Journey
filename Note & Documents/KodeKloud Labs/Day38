Pull Docker Image

Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) 
this image as busybox:local

to tag an existing docker image use docker tag command:

docker tag source_image target_image


as a soltuing 

1. dokcer pull busybox:musl
2. dokcer tag busybox:musl busybox:local
3. docker images --digests


Why tag used?
1. To rename the image
2. To prepare an image for pushing it to registry
3. To create multiple version of the same image
4. To give images meaningful labels for testings
REMEMBER: Tagging does Not dublicate the image.
It just gives new name to same image ID.
