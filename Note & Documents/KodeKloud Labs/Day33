Day 33: Resolve Git Merge Conflicts

Sarah and Max were working on writting some stories which they have pushed to the repository. 
Max has recently added some new changes and is trying to push them to the repository but he is facing some issues. 
Below you can find more details:


SSH into storage server using user max and password Max_pass123. 
Under /home/max you will find the story-blog repository.
Try to push the changes to the origin repo and fix the issues.
The story-index.txt must have titles for all 4 stories. 
Additionally, there is a typo in The Lion and the Mooose line where Mooose should be Mouse.

there was a merge conflict in file story-index.txt

as part of solution:
git fetch
git status

#On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
nothing to commit, working directory clean#

git pull origin master

#From http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog 
#* branch master -> FETCH_HEAD Auto-merging story-index.txt 
#CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in story-index.txt Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result
 vim story-index.txt

edited the file
git add story-index.txt
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
git push origin master
