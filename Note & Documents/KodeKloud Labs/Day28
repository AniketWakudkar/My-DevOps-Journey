**# Git Cherry Pick**

Task Statement:
The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/blog.git. This repo is cloned at **/usr/src/kodekloudrepos** on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:

There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is **Update info.txt**. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

Here, Update info.txt commit needs to be cherry picked from feature branch to master branch

Soloution :

SSh to storage server 
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog/        #cloned from /opt/blog.git
sudo git log --oneliner -all            #to check all commits 
#copy the commit id of Update info.txt
sudo git checkout master                #go to the branch where you want this specifix commit
sudo git cherry-pich [commit Id]        #this command will pick the required Commit from Feature branch
sudo git log --oneline                  #to check the commit has been merged into the master branch
sudo git puch origin master     #push the changes into the /opt/blog.git 


What is Cherry Pick?
Taking a specific commit from a branch and appying it to another branch.

Visual Example:

master:     A --- B --- C
                   \
feature:            D --- E --- F --- G
                          ↑
                    We want only this commit!

You want commit `E` in the master branch without taking `D`, `F`, or `G`.

**After cherry-pick:**
```
master:     A --- B --- C --- E'
                   \
feature:            D --- E --- F --- G

Syntax:   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

Why Use Cherry-Pick?
1. Emergency Bug Fixes

Bug fix is buried in a feature branch
Need it in production NOW
Don't want the incomplete feature

2. Selective Code Transfer

Want one specific change from another branch
Don't want everything else

3. Duplicate Good Work

Same fix needed in multiple branches
Copy it to each branch individually

4. Undo Accidents

Committed to wrong branch
Cherry-pick to correct branch
Delete from wrong branch
